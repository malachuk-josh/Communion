// Drawn as SVG from two public sources rather than shipped as a scan: see
// scripts/build-maps.mjs for why. What that buys here is that the map takes
// the app's own colours, so it is legible in all three themes; that it costs
// a few kilobytes rather than a few megabytes; and that it can be zoomed into
// without ever going soft, because there is nothing to go soft — every line
// is redrawn at whatever size it is asked for.
