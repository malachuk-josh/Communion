// A printing convention from 1899 and the thing readers most often ask a Bible
// app for. The hard part was never the colour — it is knowing where a speech
// starts and stops, which is a judgement about the text and not something to
// be inferred from "Jesus said" and a comma. That judgement is made once, in
// scripts/build-redletter.mjs, against an edition of the King James that marks
// every one of Christ's speeches explicitly. What is left here is the reading
// of it.
//
// A speech is stored as a run of WORD indices — [first, last] — because the
// two editions of the King James involved agree about every word and disagree
// about the odd comma. Counting words is the one thing they cannot differ on.

 *
 * `open` is why this is not just a number. The pieces do not fall on word

 * separately, and counting each piece on its own would make "voice," into two
 * words where the verse has one, putting every index after it out by one and
 * every red letter in the wrong place. So the cursor remembers whether the
 * last thing it set ended mid-word, and carries the word on if it did.
