// Reading a chapter of somebody else's translation.
//
// Two APIs, several sets of house rules, one shape at the end of it — the same
// {verse, text} rows the static files hand over, so nothing above this file has
// to know which kind of translation it is looking at. Crossway serves the ESV
// itself; API.Bible serves the NKJV and the NASB, which share a key and an
// adapter and differ in how they punctuate a poem.
//
// The keys never leave the server. Both APIs authenticate with a bearer-style
// header and neither offers per-origin restriction, so a key in the browser is
// a key anyone can lift and spend this app's daily allowance with.
//
// A chapter at a time, and only ever a chapter. Both licences cap what may be
// held at around five hundred verses — a few chapters of anything — so there
// is deliberately no way to ask this file for a book.

 * Take the acrostic heading off the end of a verse.
 *
 * The alphabetic poems are printed with each letter standing over its stanza,

 * does not cover, so it arrives in the text with no marker of its own. Falling
 * between two verses, it lands on the end of the one before. The two
 * publishers print it differently and both leak: the NKJV's verse 8 of Psalm
 * 119 ends "...forsake me utterly! [bet] Beth", the NASB's ends
 * "...utterly abandon me! Beth" with no Hebrew character at all.
 *
 * Which is why this cannot simply cut a trailing letter name. "He" is one of
 * the twenty-two and also an ordinary English word: Isaiah 41:4 ends "I am
 * He", and a rule that reached for the name alone would quietly edit it.
 *
 * So nothing is cut on the strength of the name. lib/acrostic.ts already knows
 * which verse opens which stanza — the same table that draws these letters
 * where they belong — and a heading is only taken off a verse when the verse
 * after it is due to open a stanza, and only when what is trailing is a
 * spelling of that particular letter. Anywhere else the words are the text.
